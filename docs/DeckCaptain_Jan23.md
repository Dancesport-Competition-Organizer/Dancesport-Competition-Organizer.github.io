# Overview

Your main responsibilities are checking in, adding, or scratching couples / TBAs. Before anyone goes on the floor, all couples should be checked in and TBAs should be paired or scratched. All couples dancing (TBA couples included) must have a number. 

Current and upcoming events are shown on the left-hand column of the screen. The upcoming event and couples registered to compete are displayed on the right-hand column.

### TBAs

When pairing TBAs, select individuals by name from the dropdown or type in the partner's name. If necessary, a placeholder name can be entered, as this can be corrected later. 

If TBA doesn't get paired, scratch the competitor from the event.

### Adding Dancers

Couples or new TBAs can be added from any tab (All Couples, Not Checked In, TBAs) via the Add Couple button. Leads must have a number to be added from this view (aka they must be registered at the competition). If they do not have a number, they cannot be added until this is resolved by registration. 

### Check In

You can check in couples one at a time (Check In) or all at once (Check-in All). When everyone is checked in, the scrutineer's view will be updated to inform them the event is ready to start.
