# Register

You can register as a partnership, TBA, or both. If you are registering on behalf of a team, please enter entries one at a time.
### All Registrants 

Once you add your name, Lilac DB will calculate your current YCN points and show which events you are eligible for. This is simply a warning - DSCO will not restrict you from registering for specific events. You can also check YCN points directly at [db.lilacdancecenter.com/ycn](http://db.lilacdancecenter.com/ycn). 

If your school or affiliate organization is not listed, you can write in your organization. 
#### For partnerships:

Submit the registration form once per partnership. If you have multiple partnerships (for example, you have separate partners for standard and latin), you will need to register twice.
#### For TBAs: 

If you are registered as a TBA and you find a partner before the competition, you will need to unregister as a TBA and re-register as a partnership. 
### Add Events

If you've already registered and want to add events, complete the competitor registration form again. 
### Drop Events

Each dancer is assigned one code to manage their events. If you lose your registration code and would like to drop an event, reach out to the competition organizers for your code. 

To drop events, click **Update Entries** from the homepage and enter your confirmation code. When you click Drop, you will receive a pop-up box to confirm that you want to drop the event. 

After registration closes, you will not be able to update your events online.
# View Entries 

**View Current Entries** shows all competitors by event and all events available. To see the list of all competitors by name, click **View by Competitor** on the Entries page. 
# View Results

Once the competition is finished, the Results button is posted on the homepage. Under Results, you'll see the rankings for each final by event. Click **View Details** under any event to see all rankings and marks by round.
